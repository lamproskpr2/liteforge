## Why LiteForge?

- **No Virtual DOM** — Direct, surgical DOM updates via Signals and Effects
- **Zero-Flicker Architecture** — Components render only when async data is fully loaded
- **Fine-Grained Reactivity** — Automatic dependency tracking, no manual subscriptions
- **JSX Syntax** — Familiar developer experience with build-time optimization
- **Unified Context System** — One `use()` function for stores, router, and services
- **Type-Safe by Default** — Full TypeScript support with strict typing

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @liteforge/core @liteforge/runtime @liteforge/vite-plugin
```

**vite.config.ts**

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import liteforge from '@liteforge/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [liteforge()]
})
```

**main.tsx**

```tsx
import { createApp } from '@liteforge/runtime';
import { devtoolsPlugin } from '@liteforge/devtools';

// Import app components
import { App } from './App.js';
import { createAppRouter } from './router.js';
import { authStore } from './stores/auth.js';
import { uiStore } from './stores/ui.js';

const app = await createApp({
  root: App,
  target: '#app',
  router: createAppRouter(),
  stores: [authStore, uiStore],
  
  // DevTools plugin - press Ctrl+Shift+D to open
  plugins: [
    devtoolsPlugin({
      shortcut: 'ctrl+shift+d',  // Keyboard shortcut to toggle panel
      position: 'right',          // Panel position: 'right' | 'bottom' | 'floating'
      defaultTab: 'signals',      // Default tab: 'signals' | 'stores' | 'router' | 'components' | 'performance'
      width: 400,                 // Panel width (for right position)
      maxEvents: 500,             // Max events to keep in buffer
    }),
  ],
  
  context: {
    // Mock API client (in real app, would be actual API client)
    api: {
      baseUrl: '/api',
      get: async (url: string) => {
        console.log(`[API] GET ${url}`);
        return {};
      },
      post: async (url: string, data: unknown) => {
        console.log(`[API] POST ${url}`, data);
        return {};
      },
    },
  },
  debug: true,
});
```

## Core Concepts

### Signals

Signals are reactive values that automatically track dependencies:

```ts
import { signal, computed, effect } from '@liteforge/core'

const count = signal(0)
const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2)

effect(() => {
  console.log(`Count is ${count()}, doubled is ${doubled()}`)
})

count.set(5)  // Logs: "Count is 5, doubled is 10"
```

### Components

Components have a clear lifecycle with async data loading:

```tsx
import { createComponent } from '@liteforge/runtime'

const UserProfile = createComponent({
  props: {
    userId: { type: String, required: true }
  },

  async load({ props }) {
    const user = await fetch(`/api/users/${props.userId}`).then(r => r.json())
    return { user }
  },

  placeholder: () => <div class="skeleton" />,

  component: ({ data }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.user.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.user.email}</p>
    </div>
  )
})
```

### Store

Global state management with automatic reactivity:

```ts
import { defineStore } from '@liteforge/store'

const userStore = defineStore('users', {
  state: {
    currentUser: null,
    list: []
  },
  getters: (state) => ({
    isLoggedIn: () => state.currentUser() !== null
  }),
  actions: (state) => ({
    async fetchUsers() {
      state.list.set(await fetch('/api/users').then(r => r.json()))
    }
  })
})
```

### Router

Full-featured routing with guards and lazy loading:

```ts
import { createRouter, lazy } from '@liteforge/router'

const router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
    { path: '/users/:id', component: lazy(() => import('./UserDetail')) },
    { 
      path: '/admin', 
      component: AdminLayout,
      guard: 'auth',
      children: [
        { path: '/', component: Dashboard }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

### Control Flow

Reactive control flow primitives:

```tsx
import { Show, For, Switch, Match } from '@liteforge/runtime'

<Show when={() => user()}>
  <UserCard user={user} />
</Show>

<For each={() => items()}>
  {(item) => <li>{item.name}</li>}
</For>

<Switch fallback={<NotFound />}>
  <Match when={() => status() === 'loading'}>Loading...</Match>
  <Match when={() => status() === 'error'}>Error!</Match>
</Switch>
```

## Philosophy

LiteForge is built on these principles:

1. **Simplicity over abstraction** — Clear, predictable behavior without magic
2. **Performance by default** — Fine-grained updates without diffing overhead
3. **Developer experience** — Familiar JSX syntax with excellent TypeScript support
4. **Zero runtime cost for static content** — Build-time optimization extracts static HTML

## Status

> **LiteForge is in active early development (v0.1.x).** APIs may change between minor versions. I use it in my own production projects, but if you adopt it today, expect some rough edges.

LiteForge is a personal framework born from real frustration with React's re-rendering model and Vue's adapter overhead. I built it because I wanted a tool that works the way I think — signals that directly update the DOM, no virtual DOM diffing, no magic.

I'm actively building real applications on top of it (scheduling software, business tools, DevOps dashboards), so the framework evolves based on actual needs, not theoretical purity.

**What works well today:** Core reactivity, routing, state management, forms, data tables, and the calendar — all battle-tested through my own projects.

**What's still maturing:** Documentation, edge cases in complex layouts, and the ecosystem around it.

If you find it useful, feel free to use it. If you find a bug, I'd appreciate an issue. PRs are welcome but please open an issue first so we can discuss the approach.

## Built with AI

I want to be transparent: LiteForge was developed with significant AI assistance. I used Claude (Anthropic) as a development partner throughout the entire process — from architecture decisions to implementation, testing, and documentation.

**What that means in practice:**
- I designed the API, made all architecture decisions, and defined what the framework should do
- AI helped write implementation code, tests, and documentation based on my specifications
- Every feature was reviewed, tested, and validated by me in real browser environments
- The framework reflects my opinions and preferences as a developer, not generic AI output

I believe AI-assisted development is the future of how software gets built. Being upfront about it is more honest than pretending otherwise. The code quality speaks for itself — 1400+ tests, TypeScript strict mode, zero external dependencies.
